## About the practice

For the second practice we are interested in analyzing the evolution of MATLAB questions in StackOverflow and building a predictive time series model. 

In the StackOverflow.csv file, you can find data on the number of new questions that are questions asked monthly for the different programming languages.

### Specific tasks

 - Analyze the data in MATLAB, among other analyses, plot the series, study seasonality and stationarity.
series, study seasonality and stationarity.

- Separate the sample into three parts: training, validation (12 months) and test (6 months).
months) and test (6 months). When validation is not necessary, the test sample should be of 6 months.

- We should look for the best predictive model among the following:
    - ETS
    - ARIMA
    - 4Theta
    - TBATS

- Once the model has been selected, a 12-month out-of-sample prediction should be performed.
months out-of-sample.

## Built with
