- Visual Code
- Sktime
- Darts

## Content of the repository

- `Practice 1- Apple`: In this first practice we must predict Apple's sales, using quarterly data from Q1 1990 to Q2 2021 obtained from Bloomberg. In addition, we have the latest report by Barclays Research with predictions for the next quarters up to 2022 to help us with the process. We will also have to solve specific objectives.

- `Practice 2- StackOverflow`:  In this practice we will carry out an analysis of the evolution of the questions related to 'Matlab', we will test different models and we will build a predictive model of time series with the one that has given us the best result. In addition, we must solve some specific objectives.

- `Practice 3 (Final)- TOSCOS`:  This is the final practice of the subject, valuable as an exam. It's similar to the Rossman Store Sales exercise of Kaggle, but with synthetic values.
