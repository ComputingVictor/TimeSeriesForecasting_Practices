<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://www.cleverfiles.com/howto/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/apple-stock-price.jpg" /></div>


## About the practice

In this first practice we must predict Apple's sales, using quarterly data from Q1 1990 to Q2 2021 obtained from Bloomberg. In addition, we have the latest report by Barclays Research with predictions for the next quarters up to 2022 to help us with the process.

### Specific objectives

- Apply the estimation and selection of ETS models.
- Apply the estimation and selection of ARIMA models.
- Determine the accuracy of the predictions.

In addition, we must answer the following questions:

- Is Apple's revenue stationary? In average? In variance?
- What is your trend? and its seasonal component?
- What are Apple's annual sales?
- What are the annual revenue growth?
- Which model predicts better?
- Is there a COVID effect? Quantify.
- What are the accumulated sales for the year 2021? And for 2022?
- Are the Barclays predictions credible?
