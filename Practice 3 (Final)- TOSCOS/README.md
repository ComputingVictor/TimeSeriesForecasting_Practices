## About the practice

This is the final practice of the subject, valuable as an exam. It's similar to the Rossman sales exercise, but with synthetic values. The statement is the following:

The file data.csv contains the sales (Sales) of the ten stores of the TOSCOS supermarket chain.

These are daily data and in addition to the sales you have information about the number of customers that have entered in each store (Customers), if it is open (Open), if you have promotions (Promo), if it is a holiday (StateHoliday) and if it is a school day (SchoolHoliday).

The stores are divided into 3 zones (1, 2 and 3) and have 3, 3 and 4 stores respectively. Thus store T2c, is store c in zone 2. The objective is to predict sales from August 1, 2015 to September 10, 2015.

The student can decide which model(s) to use to achieve the objectives of the case study.

Anything that is not directly stated in the statement and should or will be used should be clearly indicated.

### Specific tasks

1. Graph the daily sales of the 10 stores.
2. Plot the daily sales of the 3 zones.
3. Plot daily sales totals.
4. Plot weekly sales totals.
5. Predict the daily total sales.
6. Predict weekly total sales.

The code that has been used for the resolution of the case and a report (or presentation) for the CEO of the company must be submitted.
